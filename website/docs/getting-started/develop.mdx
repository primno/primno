# Develop

To run the developer mode, execute the following command in your project folder:

```bash
mn start
```

This command will build and deploy a special version of Primno that will use your local files instead of the files in Power Apps.
Local files are loaded through a local web server started on port 12357.

:::important
The website starts with a self-signed certificate. The certificate is automatically regenerated every 30 days.

You must accept it in your browser by browsing to [https://localhost:12357](https://localhost:12357).
:::

This command also starts a watcher that will automatically rebuild your project when you change a file.

## Try it

Try to change the text displayed when loading the form in `src/record/account/account.component.ts` to something else then save the file.

After refreshing the browser, you will see the new text.

Below is a video that shows the developer mode in action.

<ReactPlayer url={HomeMovieUrl} muted={true} height={480} width={640} controls={true} />

## What's next

:::caution
Remember to close the developer mode when you are done by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
Then, run `mn deploy` to publish your changes to Power Apps.

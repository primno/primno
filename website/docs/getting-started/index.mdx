# Getting Started

## Overview

This guide will help you take your first steps with Primno.

You will create a project that:
- Show an alert when a `account` form is loaded.
- Notify the user that some columns changed on a `account` form.
- Show a alert when a button on a `contact` grid is clicked.

Below you can see a video that shows the final result of this guide.

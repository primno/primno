# Subscribe to Power Apps events

Power Apps provides a lot of events that can be subscribed to. For example, when a form is loaded, when a column value is changed or when a command-bar button is clicked.

With Primno, a Power Apps event can be subscribed using decorators in a component. It must be associated with a method that will be the event handler called when the event occurs.

Each events decorator is prefixed with `MnOn` and the event name is in pascal case. For example, the `Form load` event is associated with the `@MnOnFormLoad()` decorator.

```ts title="Subscribe to the form load event."
@MnOnFormLoad()
public onFormLoad(eventArg: FormEventArgs) {
    // Do something
}
```

:::important
Each event decorator has a dedicated documentation page that provides explanations and usage examples.
See the [full events list](events-list.md).

Eg: [MnOnColumnChange](../../api-reference/functions/MnOnColumnChange.md).
:::

## Page type

The page type define the main source of the event:

| Page type | Description
| --- | --- |
| Record | Fired on a form (principal form, quick create form). |
| List | Fired on a home-grid, sub-grid or associated grid. |

A event can be available on one or both page types. For example, the `form load` event is only available on a record page when the `enable rule` (command-bar) event is available on both record and list pages. See the [full events list](events-list.md).

A component defines its page type using the [Scope](../components.md#scope) property of its `MnComponent` decorator.

:::caution
A component targeting the "List" page type cannot subscribe to a "Record" event and vice versa.
:::

The page type defined the execution context of the [event handler](#event-handler), a record event performs operations on a form ([form context](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/clientapi-form-context)) when a list event performs operations on a grid ([grid context](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/clientapi-grid-context)).

## Event handler

The event handler is a component method that will be called when the event occurs.

It's argument depends on the event that occurred. For example, the `column change` event will contain the context of the form on which it is executed, whereas the `command invoke` event will contain the context of the associated grid control or form.

## Target

Some events require a target to be subscribed.
A target can be a column, control or command name. For example, `MnOnColumnChange` requires a column name, whereas `MnOnFormLoad` doesn't.

The target is specified in the decorator as a string argument or function that returns a string from the component configuration. See [Component configuration](../components.md#configuration).

:::tip
Use the [`ConfigOf`](../../api-reference/types/ConfigOf.md) type to get the type of the component configuration.

Example:

```ts
@MnComponent({
    scope: {
        pageType: "record",
        table: 'account'
    }
})
export class MyComponent {
    @MnConfig({
        column: 'name'
    })
    config: {
        column: string;
    };

    /**
     * Subscribe to the column change event of the hard-coded column 'accountnumber'.
     */
    @MnOnColumnChange('accountnumber')
    public onAccountNumberChange(eventArg: FormEventArgs) {
        // Do something
    }

    /**
     * Subscribe to the column change event of the column specified in the configuration, here 'name'.
     */
    @MnOnColumnChange((cfg: ConfigOf<NotificationComponent>) => cfg.notificationColumn)
    public onColumnChange(eventArg: FormEventArgs) {
        // Do something
    }
}
```

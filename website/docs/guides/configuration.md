# Configuration
The configuration of primno is separated in 2 files :
primno.json : configuration
primno.env.json: Contains the connection strings for deploying to Dynamics 365. This file should not be saved in a version manager. When creating a new project, it is automatically excluded from git by adding a line in the gitignore.
